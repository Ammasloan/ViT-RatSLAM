# Sample timestamps file for extract_places.py
# Each line is a timestamp in seconds, representing a distinct location
# You need to fill in 60 timestamps by watching your bag file
# Format: timestamp_seconds  # optional comment

# Example:
# 10.5   # entrance
# 25.3   # corridor turn
# 42.1   # open area
# ...

# Delete the lines below and add your own timestamps
# Make sure to choose 60 different locations that are visually distinct

0.0    # placeholder - replace with real timestamps
